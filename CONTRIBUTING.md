## Branches

This repository uses the following branches:

- **_main_** is our main branch. We consider it stable and it is used in production.
- The **_develop_** branch is our in-development branch. When a release is ready, we decide to “freeze” that branch and merge it into **_main_** branch.

We encourage you to base your contributions on the latest **_develop_** branch. The [_Sofie Releases_](https://Sofie-Automation.github.io/sofie-core/releases) page collects the status and timeline of the releases.
