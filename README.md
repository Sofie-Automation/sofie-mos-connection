This is the _MOS-Connection_ library of the [**Sofie** TV Automation System](https://github.com/nrkno/Sofie-TV-automation/), used for connecting to a _MOS_ device using the [MOS Protocol](http://mosprotocol.com/).

## Getting Started

### Installation

```bash
npm install @mos-connection/connector
or
yarn add @mos-connection/connector
```

### Usage

_See more examples in the [examples](/packages/examples/src) folder!_

```typescript
import { MosConnection } from '@mos-connection/connector'

let mos = new MosConnection(new ConnectionConfig({
	mosID: 'my.mos.application',
	acceptsConnections: true,
	profiles: {
		'0': true,
        '1': true,
        '2': true,
        '4': true
	},
	openRelay: true
	debug: false
}))
mos.onConnection((device: MosDevice) => { // called whenever there is a new connection to a mos-device
	if (device.hasConnection) { // true if we can send messages to the mos-server
	    device.getMachineInfo().then((lm) => {
			console.log('Machineinfo', lm)
		})
	}
	// Setup callbacks to pipe data:
	device.onRequestMachineInfo(() => {})
	device.onCreateRunningOrder((ro) => {})
	device.onDeleteRunningOrder((RunningOrderID: MosString128) => {})
	device.onReadyToAir(() => {})
	// ...
})
```

### Quick-MOS

"Quick-MOS" is a simple MOS application that can be used to test the MOS-connection library.

It reads data-files from disk and pretends to be an NRCS, so you can connect other MOS-clients to it.

See [Quick-MOS](/packages/quick-mos/README.md) for more information.

## MOS Support

The MOS-Connection library currently supports the [MOS Protocol version **2.8.5**](https://mosprotocol.com/wp-content/MOS-Protocol-Documents/MOS_Protocol_Version_2.8.5_Final.htm).

### Supported MOS Profiles

| Profile   | Status                |
| --------- | --------------------- |
| Profile 0 | Implemented           |
| Profile 1 | Implemented           |
| Profile 2 | Implemented           |
| Profile 3 | Implemented           |
| Profile 4 | Implemented           |
| Profile 5 | Not implemented (yet) |
| Profile 6 | Not implemented (yet) |
| Profile 7 | Not implemented (yet) |

Pull Requests for the remaining profiles would be happily accepted!

## Packages

MOS-Connection consists of 3 packages:

- **@mos-connection/connector** is a Node.js library is used to connect to MOS devices or act as a MOS Server/NCS.
  The `helper` and `model` functionality is included in this library as well.
- **@mos-connection/helper** is a library that provides various functions useful for those that prepare/handle data that will be sent to (or has been received by) the MOS-connection.
  The `model` functionality is included in this library as well.
- **@mos-connection/model** is a library that contains types and enums, useful for applications that handles MOS-data.

There is also a helper application **quickMos** designed to be a minimal mock MOS server for testing client applications.
